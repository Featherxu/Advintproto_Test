          <p class="paragraph-20">&quot;In some organizations, only prototypes which act as proof that an artifact can be produced are respected. In others, only highly detailed representations of look and feel are well understood.&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-47">
          <p class="paragraph-21">The fidelity and resolution of prototype for each project have a lot difference based on their purposes. When we are trying to figure out user flow with the product, we might do a low fidelity prototype just to see how people interact with it. But if we are showing it to our end users to check the micro interactions, we might</p>

      <div class="div-block-44">
        <div class="div-block-45">
          <p class="paragraph-20">&quot;Implementation usually requires a working system to be built; look and feel requires the concrete user experience to be simulated or actually created; role requires the context of the artifact’s use to be established.&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-46">
          <p class="paragraph-21">The book talks a lot about implementation, look and feel, and roles, which leads to what we should focus on when we do the prototype. Prototype should be built upon a question that designer trying to figure out, but not to mindlessly build it for the sake of prototypes. And implementation, look and feel and role is not running in a sequence, they should be concerned parallel. I think they represents why are we designing, who are we designing for and how we design it.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-20">&quot;Know your prototype; prepare your audience. Be clear about what design questions are being explored with a given prototype—and what are not. Communicating the specific purposes of a prototype to its audience is a critical aspect of its use.&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-48">
          <p class="paragraph-21">Before we talk to our audience, it&#x27;s very important to know what do we have and why do we have that specific prototype. I feel very relatable that it&#x27;s crucial to understand it ourselves fully before reaching out to others. Once I went to a user testing without knowing what&#x27;s the purpose of the prototype and having no idea about what should I figure out with that session. Turns out both my user and myself are lost in the session. Also we should not only be clear with the prototype, we also need to know how to communicate it with others. A lot of practices is needed.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-41">1.</h2>
      <div class="div-block-44">
        <div class="div-block-45">
          <p class="paragraph-20">&quot;We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-47">
          <p class="paragraph-21">This first sentence immediately triggers me as a designer who just learned about object-oriented programming. But that make a lot of sense to me because in this world, everything is closely tied with something else, together made up a system, to have a 1+1&gt;2 effect. That&#x27;s why as a designer, it&#x27;s our responsibility to think bigger, to think about the system instead of thinking some little pieces (features) first.</p>

        <div class="div-block-45">
          <p class="paragraph-20">&quot;Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it is easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. One of the problems is that different sets of potential specifications cannot easily be envisioned all at once. Another is that a computer has to be told absolutely everything. However, once we have successfully explained how to draw something in a sufficiently general manner, the same explanation will work for related shapes, in different circumstances; so the time spent in formulating a precise explanation turns out to be worth it.&quot;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-46">
          <p class="paragraph-21">The front part saying &quot;it is easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it&quot;really makes me feel relatable, because when we are trying to code something, we might know how to do it in Figma or photoshop, but when we are trying to code it out, we need to think about the logic behind like how to make the system make sense or organize it. We are trying to communicate our vision and our ideas.</p>

        <div class="div-block-48">
          <p class="paragraph-21">Designing on paper or Figma is very different with coding it. Doing on paper you can design where the point is going to be, but on a software, we have different constraint that the points around is preset and it&#x27;s hard to change it. However, sometimes it can also have more possibilities that makes our life easier.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-20">&quot;Like the smartphone, the internet of things isn’t a single technology, but an unruly assemblage of protocols,  sensing regimes, capabilities and desires, all swept under a single rubric for the sake of disciplinary convenience.&quot;</p>

        <div class="div-block-47">
          <p class="paragraph-21">Before I read this article, when mentions the IOT, all I think about is &quot;wow this is so cool, seems like high technology&quot;. But never thought about the protocols behind it. I thought it&#x27;s an adds on to our current devices, but it&#x27;s actually another more complex system that needs to run more data behind, and problems can happens even more than usual mobile does.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-20">&quot;If wearable biometric devices are aimed, however imperfectly, at rigorous self-mastery, the colonization of the domestic environment by similarly networked products and services is intended to deliver a very different experience: convenience. The clear aim of such “smart home” efforts is to as nearly as possible short-circuit the process of reflection that stands between one’s recognition of a desire and its fulfillment via the market.&quot;</p>

        <div class="div-block-46">
          <p class="paragraph-21">The smart devices who aims to bring &quot;convenience&quot; to the users, the end goal is just to let them purchase in a quicker and non-thinking way. When things are getting easier, less thinking process is included which is also very crucial to people. The benefit at the end still lands at the business side but many people are not aware of it.</p>

They get data on the time and place of your need, as well as its frequency and intensity, and that data has value. It is, explicitly, an asset, and you can be sure they will exploit that asset in every way their terms and conditions permit them to— including by using it to develop behavioral models that map the terrain of our desires, so as to exploit them with even greater efficiency in the future.&quot;</p>

        <div class="div-block-48">
          <p class="paragraph-21">I really like the example that the author gave about Amazon button. It&#x27;s a button that when you click it, it knows ur running out of grocery and it can but it for u automatically and immediately. It&#x27;s true that it beings a lot of values to the users. But at the backend, the data Amazon can get and make use of is enormous. By knowing what kind of grocery you need at what exact time and exact frequency, and knowing side data like your age, your family situation, your gender, the big data and analysis so many information while there&#x27;s no protocol to regulate these similar products. It triggers me because I never thought about that side of the fact before.</p>
